# Supervised-learning-with-heterogenous-data-using-Random-Forest-algorithm
This was a group project where we are comparing the effectiveness of supervised learning using various multivariate data sets and i was involved doing so using Random Forest Model. I implemented the feature importance of various predictor variables and how it effects the error rate(RMSE). I used the Student Performance Dataset to show how the importance of various predictor variables. I implemented it in Python using various libraries like Numpy, Scipy, Scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn packages for plotting the figures.
